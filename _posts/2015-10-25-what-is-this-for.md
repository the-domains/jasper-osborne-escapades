So this is to be the ongoing dedicated website for husband and wife, Dominic and Paula Jasper-Osborne.

As we embark on new stages in our life, with the aims of emigrating to Canada, we wanted to keep a sort of life diary without all the noise and clutter of Facebook.

This is for ourselves and family members to keep up with us - though anybody can read this and share or oppose our views.

Looking very much forward to big changes on many levels.

Dom.
