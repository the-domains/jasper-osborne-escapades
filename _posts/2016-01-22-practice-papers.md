So it's another Sunday.

My English exams are booked for Saturday 23rd Jan - next weekend. I've received the preliminary timetable for the day so just have to ensure I am in Birmingham city centre for about 9am.

But today I am going to be working through some practice exam papers. The IELTS book has 8 to get through so the plan is to do about 3 if possible, and then a few more this week prior to the tests.

There are a lot of 'application points' hanging on the results of these English tests so hopefully they go well!
