During the months between October and December 2015, we were obtaining items requried for the application form - so replacement copies of lost qualifications; family sibling and parent photos and so on.

However, apparently in order to be able to gain any points of the large proportion given for language skills on our application forms, Dom is required to take an english test covering reading, writing, speaking and listening.

Having sourced a textbook from Oxford University, Dom had to study this over the Christmas period in preparation for the test in early 2016\. Paula was quite proud of him beavering away..!
